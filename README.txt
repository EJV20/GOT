1. Rules
	- 1 point for every status you get right
	- points for correct bonus question
	- You can put no one for killing the night king
	  if you beleive he wont die

2. How to submit
	- Run on windows 10 machine
	- Run the application called GOT_S8_Script and make your choices
	- Click the button at the bottom of the frame that says "Click here to submit".
	  Didn't think I would need to spell that out for anyone but you never know. 
	- Enter your name in the pop up window
	- In the folder that holds the application, a 
	  text file will appear in this format,
	  "<your_name>_GameOfThrones.txt"
	- You can't make any changes but you can make multiple text 
	  files using different names
	  or overwrite previous versions if you use the same name
	- Once you're done email it to me, Jeff, at "jvitunac@gmail.com"
	  and I'll let the winner know after the season ends. I plan
	  on waiting on couple days incase anyone isn't caught up.
